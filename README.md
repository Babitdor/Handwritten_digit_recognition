# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains an implementation of a Handwritten Digit Recognition model using Python and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9), and is designed to predict the correct digit for any input image.

## Features 
1. Uses the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
2. Preprocesses image data to optimize model training.
3. Builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate digit recognition.
4. Achieves high accuracy with minimal training epochs.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib (for visualizing training history and predictions)

## Dataset
The Dataset used is the <a href='http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/'>MNIST Dataset</a>
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.


## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set after training for just a few epochs.
