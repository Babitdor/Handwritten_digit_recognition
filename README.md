# Handwritten_digit_recognition

A Handwritten Digit classifier that uses CNN classification model to classify MNIST Dataset

## Description 
This is a handwritten digit recognizer, which allows users to Write Numbers and this gets input to the model.<br>
The model then predicts the digit written, and also displays the accurate alongside.

## Dataset
The Dataset used is the MNIST Dataset. The link to the data is <a href='http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/'>here</a>

### Brief Description of the Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Working
A Simple Neural Network was used, and this was trained on a GPU-enabled server from Google Collab, it was trained to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Results 
As you can see in my notebook file, the model obtained an accuracy of 99%, but it was still inconsistent, on certain types of handwritting.

## Screenshots
The Graphics User Interface was built using Pygame library.<br><br>
